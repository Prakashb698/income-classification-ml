# Census Income Classification using Machine Learning

This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K annually based on demographic and employment data from the 1994 U.S. Census.

## 📌 Objective

To apply and compare multiple classification algorithms on a structured dataset, evaluating their performance using standard classification metrics, and identifying the most effective model.

## 🧠 Models Used

- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Classifier (Linear Kernel)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Label encoded categorical variables
- Created synthetic dataset replicating census data structure
- Performed train-test split (80-20)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Misclassification Rate  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report

All results were compiled into a comparison table for easy analysis.
